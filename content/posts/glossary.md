> Basis Points - 1/100th of a percent (typically abbreviated in `bp`, `bps` or `bips`), i.e. percent of a percent. so e.g. 25 basis points = .25%, 100 basis points if 1%  

> Pyramiding - incrementally adding to a winning position, e.g. 50% initial entry on a position that should take 10% of your portfolio, followed by 30% on a pull back, finally 20% on consolidation:

```
portfolio = $100K
10% of portfolio = $10K
10x100bps = 1000 bps 
initial entry = 500bps of $100K = $5,000
pull back purchase = 300bps of $100K = $3,000
last entry = 200bps of $100K = $2,000
```
