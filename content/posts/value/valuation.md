- the value of a company rests on its _value drivers_, which varies from company to company.
- understanding the value drivers of companies allows you to identify _value plays_ (buying undervalued stocks)
- two approaches to valuation: _intrinsic_ vs _relative_ (pg 5-7)
  > intrinsic - the investment is worth the future cash flows over its life time (in today's worth), also discounted by perceived risk   
  > relative - the investment is priced relative to others in the peer group
- in practise, mix of both approaches is best

## Accounting 101

- _balance sheet_ summarizes the assets owned vs liabilities (debts & equities)
  > what the company own (assets) vs what the company owes (debt/equity)
- _income statement_ summarizes operation / profit / loss
  > revenue vs expenses, margin, etc  
  > specifies the company's financial performance - how efficiently is the company generating profits?   
  > includes depreciation/amortization
- _statement of cash flows_ summarizes cash/cash equivalents entering / leaving the company
  > how well does the company generate cash to cover its debt and operating expenses? e.g. a company who is profitable, may not have enough cash to continue operation  
  > i.e. can the firm pay its bills?  
  > does not include depreciation/amortization

- when company has > 50% share in another company (_subsidiary_), then it must report subsidiary's assets/liabilities in the balance sheet.
